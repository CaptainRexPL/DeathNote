# DeathNote

Death Note is a minecraft plugin developed for 1.16-1.17+, it introduces a custom item that allows users to input another player's name and that player will die. Additionally, they can provide a time of death, along with a cause of death.

Obviously, this is inspired by the anime Death Note. I only wanted to bring it to life in Minecraft.

## How to use
It's simple, just give yourself the Death Note with the command /deathnote give (you can provide a player, as well, if you want)

to view all Afflictions/causes of death, just crouch and right click while holding the note.

To use the note, right click normally while holding it, and then you can start typing.

There are 3 ways of using it - 

1) simply inputting the players name, they will die of the default affliction - which is a Heart Attack. 

2) Adding 'by' after their name and a cause of death, they will die of that cause if it is valid, if its invalid it will go to the default cause.

3) Adding 'in' after the name, or cause of death, and then a timespan (e.g 10 minutes) the player won't be afflicted until that time passes.

Examples:

Herobrine -> Herobrine will die of a heart attack.

Herobrine in 10 minutes -> Herobrine will die of a heart attack in 10 minutes.

Herobrine by fire -> Herobrine will die of fire.

Herobrine by fire in 10 minutes -> Herobrine will die of fire in 10 minutes.

## But wait, that's not all, there's more!
Death Note comes with it's own internal API you can hook into with your own plugins and register your own Afflictions! That's right! You can make addons for this plugin.

API usage will be added soon.
